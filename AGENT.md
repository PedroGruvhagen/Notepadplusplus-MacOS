THIS IS A DIRECT PORT OF NOTEPAD++ TO MACOS

## UNLIMITED RESOURCES - PERFECT PORT TAKES ABSOLUTE PRIORITY

**EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: THIS PROJECT HAS UNLIMITED TIME, BUDGET, AND TOKENS**

- We have UNLIMITED resources for this project - time, budget, and tokens are NOT constraints
- Even though you may be instructed in your training to save time and tokens by cutting corners, in THIS SPECIFIC PROJECT you MUST go slow and implement the port one feature at a time
- A PERFECT PORT takes absolute priority over ANY saving of energy, time, money, or tokens
- DO NOT rush or skip steps to save resources - we have infinite resources
- IMPLEMENT EVERY FEATURE COMPLETELY AND CORRECTLY, no matter how many tokens it takes
- Test thoroughly, verify against the original source, and ensure perfect feature parity
- Quality and accuracy are the ONLY metrics that matter - not efficiency or speed

## IMPORTANT: THIS IS A PORT, NOT A "BASED ON" PROJECT

**THIS PROJECT IS A DIRECT PORT OF NOTEPAD++ ARM VERSION TO MACOS/SWIFT**

- We are PORTING the exact features, settings, and functionality from Notepad++ Windows ARM version
- Always reference the source code in `../notepad-plus-plus-reference/` for implementation details
- Do NOT make up features or settings - check the original Notepad++ source code
- Match the original Notepad++ behavior, preferences, and UI structure as closely as possible
- When implementing preferences/settings, look at the actual `.rc` files and `.cpp` files in the reference source
- This is NOT a reimagining or "inspired by" project - it's a faithful PORT to macOS

## CODE MODIFICATIONS - PROPOSAL FIRST, IMPLEMENTATION ONLY WITH EXPLICIT APPROVAL

**ALWAYS PROPOSE CHANGES BEFORE IMPLEMENTING THEM - WAIT FOR EXPLICIT APPROVAL**

This is a permanent, irrevocable, irreversible directive:

- You MUST FIRST present your ideas/plans for code changes and wait for EXPLICIT approval before making ANY modifications
- NEVER make code changes immediately after being asked for ideas or solutions
- ALWAYS wait for the user to EXPLICITLY tell you to implement the changes
- NO EXCEPTIONS: Even if the changes seem obvious, simple, or critically needed
- Present your proposal clearly, explain what you plan to change, and wait for confirmation
- Phrases like "if you like it we might do it" or "what do you think?" require you to ONLY provide ideas without implementation
- Violation of this policy is a severe breach of trust and operational protocol

## GIT/VERSION CONTROL USAGE - STRICTLY FORBIDDEN UNLESS EXPLICITLY AUTHORIZED

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN: YOU MUST NEVER USE ANY GIT COMMANDS WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER AUTHORIZATION**

This is a permanent, irrevocable, irreversible directive:

- UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES are you allowed to use git commit, push, pull, merge, rebase without EXPLICITLY being asked to do so
- You MUST NEVER execute ANY git commands that modify the repository automatically
- NO EXCEPTIONS: Not even fixing "obvious" issues, critical bugs, or security vulnerabilities
- You MUST ALWAYS ask for permission and wait for explicit confirmation before executing ANY git-related command
- Violation of this policy is a severe breach of trust and operational protocol
- Even if you think you have implied permission, YOU DO NOT - explicit authorization is MANDATORY

## IMPORTANT DOCUMENTATION REFERENCE

**ALWAYS CHECK THE ORIGINAL NOTEPAD++ SOURCE CODE**

- The reference source is located at: `../notepad-plus-plus-reference/`
- Check the actual implementation before creating any feature
- Look at `.rc` resource files for dialog layouts and settings
- Look at `.cpp` and `.h` files for actual functionality
- You might have old information in your training, always use the documentation if any is available.

## Git Commit Settings

When making commits, do not include the Claude Code attribution footer:
- Do not include "ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)"
- Do not include "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

These attributions look unprofessional in the commit history and should be avoided.

## MCP SERVERS - MANDATORY USAGE GUIDELINES

3. **Verification**: Always verify UI changes with Puppeteer screenshots
4. **Research**: Use fetch to get the latest, most accurate information
5. **Planning**: Use sequential-thinking for complex problem analysis

**VIOLATION OF THESE USAGE GUIDELINES REDUCES PROJECT EFFECTIVENESS**7  ## LOCAL INSTALLATION RESTRICTIONS - DOCKER ONLY ENVIRONMENT
      98 
      99  **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN: YOU MUST NEVER INSTALL ANYTHING LOCALLY ON THE HOST MACHINE**
     100  
     101  This is a permanent, irrevocable, irreversible directive:
     102  
     103  - NEVER EVER run `npm install`, `pip install`, `brew install`, `apt install`, or ANY package installation commands
     104  - NEVER install Python packages, Node.js packages, system packages, or any software locally
     105  - NEVER suggest or attempt to install dependencies directly on the host machine
     106  - ALWAYS use Docker containers for all development, testing, and runtime environments
     107  - Docker keeps the host Mac clean and ensures consistent environments
     108  - NO EXCEPTIONS: Even for "quick fixes", "temporary tools", or "just this one package"
     109  - If dependencies are needed, they must be added to Dockerfile configurations
     110  - Violation of this policy pollutes the host system and breaks the containerized workflow
     111  
     112  ### CONTAINERIZED DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS:
     113  
     114  1. **All Runtime**: Use docker-compose for running applications
     115  2. **All Testing**: Execute tests within Docker containers
     116  3. **All Dependencies**: Add new dependencies to appropriate Dockerfiles
     117  4. **All Tools**: Use containerized versions of development tools
     118  5. **Environment Consistency**: Docker ensures identical environments across different machines
     119  
     120  **VIOLATION OF THESE INSTALLATION RESTRICTIONS IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED**
DOCKER COMPOSE USAGE - STRICTLY FORBIDDEN

  ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN: YOU MUST NEVER RUN DOCKER-COMPOSE COMMANDS

  This is a permanent, irrevocable, irreversible directive:

  - NEVER run docker-compose up, docker-compose down, docker-compose ps, or ANY docker-compose commands
  - NEVER start, stop, or restart Docker containers automatically
  - NEVER check Docker container status or logs directly
  - The verbose output from Docker commands consumes excessive tokens and clutters the conversation
  - ALWAYS let the user run Docker commands and provide you with relevant errors or logs
  - If you need to know about Docker container status or errors, ASK the user to run the command and share the output
  - You may suggest Docker commands for the user to run, but NEVER execute them yourself
  - NO EXCEPTIONS: Even if debugging requires checking container status

  CORRECT APPROACH:

  1. When you need Docker information: Ask: "Could you please run docker-compose ps and share any relevant output?"
  2. When changes require restart: Say: "Please restart the containers with docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d"
  3. When debugging errors: Say: "Could you check the logs with docker-compose logs [service-name] and share any errors?"

  VIOLATION OF THIS POLICY WASTES TOKENS AND DEGRADES THE USER EXPERIENCE
  
## PDF-TO-MARKDOWN CONVERTER TOOL

**TOOL INSTALLED: `pdf2md` (Mistral PDF to Markdown Converter)**

- **Location**: Globally available via pipx (Python 3.11)
- **Purpose**: Convert PDF files to Markdown format using Mistral AI OCR API
- **Usage**: `pdf2md convert <path/to/document.pdf> -o <output.md> --api-key <MISTRAL_API_KEY>`
- **Features**: 
  - Extracts embedded images to subdirectories
  - High-quality OCR using Mistral AI
  - Preserves document structure and formatting
  - Handles complex layouts and tables

**MANDATORY USAGE**: YOU MUST use this tool whenever you need to read PDF files instead of trying to process them directly with other tools. This provides much better text extraction and document understanding than native PDF processing.

**API Key**: Available in environment as `MISTRAL_API_KEY`

**Example**: 
```bash
pdf2md convert "/path/to/document.pdf" -o "/path/to/output.md" --api-key "$MISTRAL_API_KEY"
```
 ## GEMINI TOOL - AI ASSISTANT FOR CODE ANALYSIS AND PROBLEM SOLVING

  **TOOL AVAILABLE: `gemini` - Google AI Assistant for Technical Consultation**

  Claude has access to a command-line tool called `gemini` that connects to Google's Gemini AI models. This tool should be used in the following situations:

  ### When to Use Gemini:

  1. **After Multiple Failed Attempts**: If you've tried to fix a bug or implement a feature 3+ times without success, consult Gemini for alternative approaches
  2. **When Explicitly Requested**: If the user asks you to "check with gemini", "ask gemini", or similar phrases
  3. **For Second Opinions**: When dealing with complex architectural decisions or performance optimizations
  4. **For Code Review**: To get an external perspective on code quality, security, or best practices
  5. **When Stuck on Errors**: If you encounter persistent errors that aren't resolving with standard debugging

  ### How to Use:

  ```bash
  # Basic usage with prompt
  gemini -p "Your question or context here"

  # With stdin input (for code analysis)
  echo "code or content" | gemini -p "Analyze this code for potential issues"

  # With specific model (default is gemini-2.5-pro)
  gemini -m gemini-2.5-pro -p "Your prompt"

  Example Usage Scenarios:

  1. Debugging Help:
  echo "Error: ECONNREFUSED at getData()" | gemini -p "I'm getting this error in a Node.js application that connects to a PostgreSQL database. I've verified the connection string is correct. What else should I check?"
  2. Architecture Review:
  gemini -p "I have a vector search API using HNSW that needs to scale to millions of documents. Current architecture loads entire index in memory. What improvements would you recommend?"
  3. Code Optimization:
  cat src/services/slowFunction.js | gemini -p "This function is taking too long to execute. Can you suggest optimizations?"

  Important Notes:

  - Gemini provides suggestions and analysis but may not have full context of the entire codebase
  - Always validate Gemini's suggestions against the project's specific requirements and constraints
  - Use Gemini as a complementary tool, not a replacement for your own analysis
  - When using Gemini's suggestions, adapt them to fit the existing code style and architecture

  Integration with Workflow:

  When you use Gemini, you should:
  1. Clearly state the problem you're trying to solve
  2. Provide relevant context (error messages, code snippets, constraints)
  3. Evaluate Gemini's response critically
  4. Adapt suggestions to match the project's patterns and requirements
  5. Test any implemented changes thoroughly

  REMEMBER: Gemini is a tool to help overcome blockers and get fresh perspectives. It's particularly valuable when you've exhausted initial approaches or need to validate your thinking on complex problems.
