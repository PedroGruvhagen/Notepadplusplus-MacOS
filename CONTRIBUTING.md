# Contributing to Notepad++ for macOS

Hey there! üëã Thanks for considering contributing to this project! I really appreciate any help I can get, this is a big undertaking and I'm learning as I go.

## üéØ What This Project Is About

I'm trying to port Notepad++ from Windows to macOS because I miss it so much after switching to Mac. This is a **literal translation** project - I'm not trying to reimagine Notepad++ or make it "better", I just want the exact same experience on macOS.

## ü§ù How You Can Help

### I Really Need Help With:

1. **Translation Work** - Converting C++ code from Notepad++ to Swift
2. **Testing** - Finding bugs and missing features
3. **macOS Expertise** - Making it feel native on Mac
4. **Performance** - Optimizing for large files
5. **Missing Features** - There are SO many features still to port!

### Types of Contributions Welcome:

- üêõ **Bug reports** - Tell me what's broken
- üîß **Bug fixes** - Even better, fix what's broken!
- ‚ú® **Feature ports** - Help translate features from the original
- üìù **Documentation** - Help others understand the code
- üé® **UI/UX improvements** - Make it look and feel right on macOS
- üß™ **Testing** - Try edge cases and report issues
- üí° **Code reviews** - Tell me what I'm doing wrong (seriously!)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) or later
- Xcode 16.0+
- An Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- Some patience üòÖ

### Setting Up

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/PedroGruvhagen/Notepad--.git
cd Notepad++

# Open in Xcode
open Notepad++.xcodeproj

# Build and run (‚åòR)
```

### Important Reference Materials

We have the complete Notepad++ source code for reference:
- **Notepad++ source**: `../notepad-plus-plus-reference/`
- **Scintilla source**: `../scintilla-reference/`

**PLEASE** check these sources before implementing anything! We're doing a literal port, not a reimplementation.

## üìã Development Guidelines

### The Golden Rule: It's a PORT, Not a Rewrite!

This is super important - we're **translating** Notepad++ from C++ to Swift, not creating something new. That means:

1. **Check the original source first** - Always look at how Notepad++ does it
2. **Preserve the logic** - Keep the same algorithms and approaches
3. **Match the behavior** - It should work exactly like the Windows version
4. **Don't optimize prematurely** - First make it work, then make it fast

### Where to Find Things

#### Notepad++ Source Structure:
```
notepad-plus-plus-reference/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PowerEditor/src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Notepad_plus.cpp         # Main application logic
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Parameters.cpp           # Settings and configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ScintillaComponent/      # Editor integration
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ WinControls/             # UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PowerEditor/installer/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ themes/                  # Color themes
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ APIs/                    # Auto-completion data
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ functionList/            # Language parsing rules
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PowerEditor/src/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ langs.model.xml          # Language definitions
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ stylers.model.xml        # Syntax styling rules
```

#### Our macOS Project Structure:
```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Notepad++/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Models/                  # Data models (Document, Tab, etc.)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Views/                   # SwiftUI views
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ViewModels/              # Business logic
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Services/                # Core services (highlighting, etc.)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Extensions/              # NSTextView extensions
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ScintillaPort/           # Direct Scintilla translations
```

### How to Port a Feature

1. **Find it in the original** - Locate the feature in the C++ code
2. **Read the entire implementation** - Understand all the logic
3. **Check Scintilla if needed** - Many features use Scintilla APIs
4. **Translate to Swift** - Convert line by line, preserving logic
5. **Test thoroughly** - Make sure it works exactly the same
6. **Document what you did** - Help others understand the port

### Example: Porting Bracket Matching

```cpp
// Original from Notepad_plus.cpp
bool Notepad_plus::braceMatch()
{
    int braceAtCaret = -1;
    int braceOpposite = -1;
    findMatchingBracePos(braceAtCaret, braceOpposite);
    
    if (braceOpposite != -1)
    {
        _pEditView->execute(SCI_BRACEHIGHLIGHT, braceAtCaret, braceOpposite);
    }
}
```

```swift
// Our Swift translation
extension NSTextView {
    func braceMatch() -> Bool {
        var braceAtCaret = -1
        var braceOpposite = -1
        findMatchingBracePos(&braceAtCaret, &braceOpposite)
        
        if braceOpposite != -1 {
            execute(SCI_BRACEHIGHLIGHT, braceAtCaret, braceOpposite)
            return true
        }
        return false
    }
}
```
